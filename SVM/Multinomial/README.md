# Multinomial Classification Using Support Vector Machines

These macros are examples of how to implement the one-vs-one, one-vs-all, and directed acyclic graph (DAG) methods for multinomial classification using the HPSVM procedure. In order to use these macros, you may need to alter some things, such as, but not limited to, data and directory locations. Each file contains all the macros needed to run the methods, though there may be repetition between files.
